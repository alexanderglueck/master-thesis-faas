This directory contains the raw result files and the HTML reports generated by Apache JMeter. 

The HTML reports are provided without omitting the vendor/dist files. 
This is done in an attempt to provide readers with an easier setup without them having to search for all the
dependencies. 

These are the commands that were used to generate the results and turn them into HTML reports: 

Generating the data: 
`jmeter.bat -n -t "openwhisk.jmx" -l "openwhisk-results.csv"`

Generating the HTML reports: 
`jmeter.bat -g "openwhisk-results.csv" -o "openwhisk-report"`
